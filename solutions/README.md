## Usage

Each solution directory contains:
- `template.py` - Starter code with function signatures and documentation
- `solution.py` - Complete solution with detailed comments
- `test_cases.py` - Unit tests for verifying implementations
- `README.md` - Explanation of the solution and learning objectives

## Guidelines

1. Try to solve exercises independently before checking solutions
2. Use templates as starting points for implementations
3. Run test cases to verify your solutions
4. Compare your approach with the provided solutions
5. Experiment with modifications and improvements
